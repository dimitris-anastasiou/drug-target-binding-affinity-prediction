# Predicting Drug-Target Binding Affinity Using Machine Learning

## Objective
This project aims to predict the binding affinity between drugs and their target proteins using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop robust predictive models that can aid in the drug discovery process by accurately estimating the interaction strength between drug candidates and biological targets.
